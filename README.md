## Introduction
Customer churn is a significant issue for banks, as losing customers can greatly impact revenue and profitability. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning, allowing the bank to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Objective
To develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on historical data and interactions with the bank.

## Dataset
The dataset includes demographic information, account details, and behavioral metrics of bank customers. Each record represents a unique customer with features such as:
- `RowNumber`: Identifies the row number.
- `Customer ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Surname`: Customer's Surname
- `Gender`: Male or Female.
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Tenure`: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- `Balance`: Account balance.
- `CreditScore`: Customer's credit score.
- `NumOfProducts`: Number of products the customer has with the bank.
- `IsActiveMember`: Whether the customer is an active member.
- `EstimatedSalary`: Estimated salary.
- `Exited`: Whether the customer has churned (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove unnecessary columns that do not contribute to the prediction of customer churn.
   - Handle missing values and correct data inconsistencies.
   - Ensure that the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis and modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the distribution of features.
   - Explore the relationship between features and the target variable (Exited).
   - Identify key patterns and correlations.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Evaluate various classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
   - Use cross-validation to select the best model based on performance metrics.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Perform feature importance analysis to understand the key drivers of churn.

6. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the model into a production environment.
   - Monitor the model's performance over time and retrain as necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the data.
- Identification of patterns and correlations between features and the target variable.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- Comparison of different machine learning models.
- Evaluation using cross-validation and performance metrics.
- Selection of the best model based on performance.

## Results
- Summary of the model's performance.
- Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Insights
- Analysis of feature importance.
- Identification of high-risk customer segments.
- Recommendations for targeted retention strategies.
